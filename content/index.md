## Some things about me

I love to work on software that interacts with the physical world somehow.

Most of my carreer centered on innovation, working on computer vision and AI systems.

I studied computer science & computational mathematics.

Born, raised and living in Sevilla, Andalusia, Spain.

Currently working @ [Plain Concepts](https://www.plainconcepts.com/) as manager and AI innovator within the research group.

## Interests

* Chess: I play chess almost every day, look for me at [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/emepetres) or [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/jcarnero).
* Padel: I love to play padel, let's play a match if you are in Seville!
* Sailing: I got my license during the pandemic. Since then I try to sail whenever I can to keep practicing.
* Boulder: I used to boulder a lot before the pandemic. I hope to get back to it soon.
* Drawing: I usually like to draw portraits, and wild nature & abandon infrastructre scenes. Despite is was first printed in 1979, I highly recommend [this book](https://www.drawright.com/) to learn how to draw (available in multiple languages).
