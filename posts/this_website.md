blog.carnero.net is a personal website that I built to showcase my work and to share my thoughts on various topics. I wanted to create a space where I could share my thoughts and ideas with the world. I also wanted to create a place where I could showcase my work and share my experiences with others.

I built this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. I chose Jekyll because it is simple to use and easy to customize. I also like that it is built on [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), a programming language that I am familiar with. I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the website because it is free and easy to use. I also like that it is integrated with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a version control system that I use for my projects.
